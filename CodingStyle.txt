This document is intended for huggle developers, it describes
how the developers should write the source code.

Because huggle is being developed by multiple developers
we need to follow same standard so that the code
is easily readable and isn't a mess.

== C++ code ==

The source code written in C++ is formatted using the Allman
(also knows as ISO) style:
see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indent_style#Allman_style

Example source code:

//! This function loops Bar times and then return 0
int Foo(int Bar)
{
    while (Bar > 0)
    {
        Bar--;
    }
    return 0;
}

this style has huge advantage that brackets match vertically, so that
you can easily see if starting bracket matches the ending one.
On other hand it consumes more line than, for example K and R style.

=== Comments ===

Use them everywhere when you feel they should be used :-) especially
for code that may be hard to understand by others.

Every function and class should be documented according to doxygen
format http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/manual/docblocks.html


Please respect code of others, don't change the code of others without
consulting that with them, there may be specific reasons why something
is written in a way it's written.
